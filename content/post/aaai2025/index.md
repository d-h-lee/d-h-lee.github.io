# 🧠 Making Smarter Experiments: How AI Can Save Time and Cost in Research 

{{< spoiler text="View laypeople introduction" >}}

**Have you ever wondered how scientists figure out if a new drug works, or if online learning helps students?**  
Usually, they run experiments where they give one group the new treatment and another group nothing. But these experiments are expensive and time-consuming — so researchers are always looking for better ways to run them.

This is where **ABC3**, a smart algorithm developed by researchers at Korea University, comes in.

## 🔍 What’s the Problem?

Traditional experiments treat all participants equally — like flipping a coin to decide who gets what. But in real life, some participants provide more useful information than others. Picking them wisely could save a lot of time and money.

The challenge is to **choose participants in a way that doesn’t mess up the scientific fairness** of the experiment (called “randomization”) and still gives reliable results.

## 🤖 Meet ABC3: An AI-Powered Assistant for Experiments

ABC3 is like a thoughtful assistant for scientists. It uses **Bayesian statistics** — a branch of math that helps update beliefs based on new data — to pick the best next person to include in the study.

It does this by:
- **Reducing uncertainty** about how the treatment affects different people,
- **Keeping the experiment fair** by ensuring both treated and untreated groups are balanced,
- And **avoiding false positives**, where a treatment looks effective by accident.

All of this is done using a clever method inspired by a 1990s approach called the “Cohn Criterion,” which helps machines learn from data more efficiently.
